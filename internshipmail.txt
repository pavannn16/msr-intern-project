Hi,
Thank you for taking the time to interview for this position.
Attached is the take-home assignment. Please review it carefully and follow the NDA and integrity guidelines.
As this is an internship role, we expect you to work independently. This simulates the internship experience, where you take initiative to research, unblock yourself, make reasonable assumptions, and complete the work to the best of your ability. If you encounter a truly concrete blocker, you may reach out.
Timeline:
Exercises 1 and 2: submit by February 8, 5 PM PST. Submit whatever portions are ready. This should give you 2 weekend to work on a problem.
Exercise 3: optional but encouraged; submissions not accepted after February 13. No report required at this stage.
Interview: Try to keep some availability for an interview on dates February 9–14 (Monday–Friday, 8 AM–5 PM PST) for a 1.5-hour slot. We aim to conclude the interview process that week itself if all works out.
Completing the assignment earlier than the deadline is welcomed, as it allows us to move to the next step and reach a timely decision.
Looking forward to reviewing your work.
Best regards,
Gaurav
